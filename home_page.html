                            <p>&nbsp;Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, 
                            transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the 
                            heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that 
                            government should be transparent.</p>  
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business 
                            and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows 
                            good and just governance.  Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens 
                            about what their Government is doing.</p>  
                            <p>&nbsp;We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's 
                            effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and 
                            public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site 
                            to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public 
                            feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion 
                            dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist 
                            doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative 
                            instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included 
                            Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution 
                            (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly 
                            related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the 
                            press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in 
                            constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on 
                            these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, 
                            Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked 
                            to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first 
                            freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and 
                            Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity 
                            of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) 
                            or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
